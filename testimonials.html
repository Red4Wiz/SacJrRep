          <p class='item-text'>Throughout the year, Sailesh has demonstrated excellent leadership skills. He is a trailblazer who never hesitates to take initiative. His collaboration and communication skills are outstanding. Sailesh's dedication to his extracurriculars, such as his success in Business Council makes him an excellent candidate for the Junior Rep position.</p>

          <p class='item-text'>This year, I met Sailesh through Mackenzie's Athletic Council, and I quickly saw how valuable he is to the team. He brings new ideas to the table and is eager to take the initiative and responsibility to assist others in expanding their ideas. He's a fantastic addition to any team; he's communicative, intelligent, outgoing, and, most importantly, reliable. I can personally vouch that he will be an excellent, if not the best, junior representative Mackenzie has ever seen. Vote for Sailesh, 2022-2023.</p>

          <p class='item-text'>Sailesh is one of my closest friends, even though we haven’t known each other for a very long time. He’s really hardworking and dedicated to everything he does. He’s also a really good friend, and always helps me when I ask. For example, when I first started to learn how to code, Sailesh would always help me and answer any of my questions. I would recommend to everyone who’s reading this to VOTE SAILESH4JRREP.</p>

          <p class='item-text'>Sailesh is suitable to this position because of many reasons but mostly because he's such a great person to talk to. Taking to Sailesh is really  easy and its really fun and he always seem like he understands everything we say. He's also very smart so he'll probably think of what the people want.</p>

          <p class='item-text'>Over the centuries, Sailesh and I have bonded and gained a mutual respect for one another. That time he clutched the 1v1 in Fortnite is what really helped me recognize what a leader he is and all the strategy he uses to crank the 90s and shoot the opps. He also survived with me through the depths of tilted, and honestly speaking, Sailesh is a gamer, leader, and a good friend.</p>
