          <p class='item-text'>Throughout the year, Sailesh has demonstrated excellent leadership skills. He is a trailblazer who never hesitates to take initiative. His collaboration and communication skills are outstanding. Sailesh's dedication to his extracurriculars, such as his success in Business Council makes him an excellent candidate for the Junior Rep position.</p>

          <p class='item-text'>This year, I met Sailesh through Mackenzie's Athletic Council, and I quickly saw how valuable he is to the team. He brings new ideas to the table and is eager to take the initiative and responsibility to assist others in expanding their ideas. He's a fantastic addition to any team; he's communicative, intelligent, outgoing, and, most importantly, reliable. I can personally vouch that he will be an excellent, if not the best, junior representative Mackenzie has ever seen. Vote for Sailesh, 2022-2023.</p>

          <p class='item-text'>I have known sailesh since 7th grade. We were in the same class and we were both student council representatives of our class. He always took initiatives to lead and organize school events and made an effort to make the school a more fun and better place for our peers. He is a natural born leader and is great at problem-solving as well. The junior representative position would be great for sailesh and I am sure he won’t disappoint.</p>

          <p class='item-text'>When I heard that Sailesh was applying for junior rep, I wasn't surprised at all because I knew he would be great for the job. Sailesh is just a great person to be around, he's always so positive, and if I ever need help with anything I know I can ask Sailesh because he's always going to be there to encourage me and help me.  Whenever I'm walking through the halls with Sailesh, I feel like he says hi to half of the people we pass, and I don't know a single person who doesn't like him. Just overall Sailesh is a great guy and a good friend, and I think he would make a great junior rep.</p>

He's able to maintain a healthy balance between his work and his social life as well, which is a really important trait of a great leader, making him a great choice for Junior Rep.</p>

          <p class='item-text'>Sailesh is one of my closest friends, even though we haven’t known each other for a very long time. He’s really hardworking and dedicated to everything he does. He’s also a really good friend, and always helps me when I ask. For example, when I first started to learn how to code, Sailesh would always help me and answer any of my questions. I would recommend to everyone who’s reading this to VOTE SAILESH4JRREP.</p>

          <p class='item-text'>Although I have only known Sailesh for less than a year, he has impacted me and many others too. What makes him stand out from the other people that I see on a daily basis is his passion and perseverance for what he does. He is always working hard to reach closer to his goals and never says no to a challenge. He also has natural leadership characteristics, always taking the initiative to make decisions. However, he doesn’t boss people around but instead, listens to everybody’s opinions and works together to find the best solution. I think that Sailesh is the perfect candidate to be a great SAC junior representative!</p>

That time he clutched the 1v1 in Fortnite is what really helped me recognize what a leader he is and all the strategy he uses to crank the 90s and shoot the opps. He also survived with me through the depths of tilted, and honestly speaking, Sailesh is a gamer, leader, and a good friend.</p>
