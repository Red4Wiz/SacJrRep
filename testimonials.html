He brings new ideas to the table and is eager to take the initiative and responsibility to assist others in expanding their ideas. He's a fantastic addition to any team; he's communicative, intelligent, outgoing, and, most importantly, reliable. I can personally vouch that he will be an excellent, if not the best, junior representative Mackenzie has ever seen. Vote for Sailesh, 2022-2023.</p>

Sailesh has been a consistent contributer to athletics at Mackenzie through his help in organizing Pick 'Ems events and devoting his time to help with home basketball + volleyball games! He's got many amazing and innovative ideas, but is always willing to listen to others' input. As a member on the badminton, Sailesh is at every practice and home game and creates a positive environment for others. Sailesh has the skills that makes him more than qualified to be Mackenzie's Junior Rep!</p>
