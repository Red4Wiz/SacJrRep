      <p>My name is Sailesh Badri, and I’m running for the Junior Representative position in the 2022-2023 Student Council. Firstly, there are countless leadership experiences I have taken part in that would greatly complement the position as Junior Representative. I was a part of my middle school's student council for two years. In the council, I helped organize and present various school-wide initiatives to students. I was also a member of the athletic council this year where I helped create and run various Athletic initiatives and events throughout the year, like the pick 'em challenges. Moreover, I’ve been an active member of various other clubs and teams this year at Mackenzie this year, such as MSC, MEC, MCPT, Robotics Team, Business Council, Badminton Team & Math club. These past experiences have equipped me with the skills I need to be the amazing Junior Representative you all deserve. Ultimately, you need a lion who could make plans, take action, and get you results, and I’m exactly that! So, make sure to vote for Sailesh Badri for Junior Representative on June 1st. GO LYONS!</p>
